Visit Bieszczady is a website project providing information about south-east region of Poland, where located is one of the country national park. 
Main idea of the website is focusing on the promoting this destination for foreign tourists. 

Project contains general information about the Bieszczady Mountains, included what is worth to see and also tips about the outdoor activities. 
It presents also photos gallery and contains contact form and the map of the region. 

The main role of this project is to introduce this still undiscovered area to the foreigners and invite them to pick up Bieszczady for their next travel destination. 
Specially, this website dedicated is for the people, who are looking for a little break in their lives, to find a necessary balance, far away from the city’s rush, 
in this peaceful area close to the nature.

I recommend this website also to those ones, who like to discover virgin parts of the globe and for all enthusiasts of outdoor activities and water sport’s funs. 
This project encourages tourist to try outdoor activities like: hiking, mountain biking but also yoga and meditation.  
Website contains useful links to the local organisations, that can help with organization of the travel and accommodation issues.

  ### Design

    - #### Color Scheme:

    The two main colors used are white and gray.

   - #### Typography:

    The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Oswald is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

   - #### Imagery:

    Imagery is important. The large, background hero images are used to catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
